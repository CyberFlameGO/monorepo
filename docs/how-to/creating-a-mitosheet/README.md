{% embed url="https://youtu.be/URM6kGfOJuM" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before rendering a Mitosheet, make sure [you've installed Mito correctly. ](../../getting-started/installing-mito/)If you just installed mito, **make sure to refresh your JupyterLab notebook.**
{% endhint %}

To create a Mitosheet, open a new or existing JupyterLab notebook. The common command to start JupyterLab is `python -m jupyter lab`. If you don't know how to create a JupyterLab notebook, you can watch this [8 second video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL0IxDAOEc0)

Once you've created a notebook, copy and paste the code below into a Jupyter code cell.

```python
import mitosheet
mitosheet.sheet()
```

Then run the Mitosheet generating code by clicking on the code cell that contains it and pressing **Shift + Enter**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a Mitosheet does not appear, make sure that you followed the [Installation Instructions](../../getting-started/installing-mito/). If you ran the installer already, make sure to **refresh your JupyterLab server.**
{% endhint %}

Now that you've created your first Mitosheet, you're ready to[ import data into Mito.](../importing-data-to-mito.md)
