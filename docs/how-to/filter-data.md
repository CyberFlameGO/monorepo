# Filter Data

## Filter By Condition

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/gL8qZ-qslcI" %}

Mito provides powerful filtering through a combination of filters and filter groups.&#x20;

1. Filters are a single condition that evaluates to true or false for each cell in the column.
2. Filter Groups are aggregations of filters combined with an **And/Or**.

To access Mito's column filters, click on the **filter button** in the column header, and then click the **Add Filter** dropdown.

Mito's filters are acceptive, meaning that only cells where the filter conditions are met will remain in the dataset.&#x20;

## Filter By Value

Mito's filtering by value is designed to help you identify all of the unique values in your column, and easily remove the ones you don't want.&#x20;

Access filtering by unique values in the **Values** tab of the Column Control Panel. For each unique value in the column, the tab displays: the value itself, the number of rows that are that value, and ther percent of rows that are that value.&#x20;

To filter out a value from your column, just **toggle the checkbox** next to the value you want to remove.&#x20;

To help you identify values you might want to remove, you can **sort** and **search** the unique value.&#x20;
