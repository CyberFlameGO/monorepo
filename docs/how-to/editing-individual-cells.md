# Editing Individual Cells

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/4YbD9_262jU" %}

Mito lets you directly edit the value of any cell, as long as the column is not created through a formula. Just double click on the cell and edit the value in the cell editor. Intelligent type handling will make sure your edits make sense in the context of your data.
