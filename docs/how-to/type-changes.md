# Type Changes

Mito's point and click type changes make it easy to identify the data type of each column in your dataframe, and cast those columns to a different type.

#### Identifying Data Types

For each column in your dataframe, the datatype is displayed in the column header. The icon will help you distinguish between int, floats, strings, booleans, and dates/time deltas.

#### Changing Data Types

There are two ways to change the data type of columns inside Mito.

Firstly, for data columns (any column that was not created by a Mito spreadsheet formula), you can use the **column dtype select dropdown** in the column control panel. Just select the dtype that you want to cast the column series to.

For formula columns, you can use the typecasting spreadsheet formulas. To do so, add the VALUE, TEXT BOOL, or DATEVALUE function to your formula to convert your column to a number, string, boolean, or datetime respectively.

For example, to convert the result of an IF statement to a boolean, wrap the if statement in the BOOL function.

```
=BOOL(IF(A > 100, 1, 0))
```

The resulting column will have `true` for each row where A is greater than 100 and `false` for each row where A is less than or equal to 100.
