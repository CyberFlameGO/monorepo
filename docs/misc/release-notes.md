## 2022-5-9 <a href="#2022-5-9" id="2022-5-9"></a>

Bug fixes:

## 2022-5-5 <a href="#2022-4-21" id="2022-4-21"></a>

Bug fixes:

* Better right click tracking so Mito can better prioritize context menus.
* Fix minor bug where analysis id was not written to mitosheet.sheet call in rare circumstances.
* Better tracking when Plotly fails to define.

## 2022-4-21 <a href="#2022-4-21" id="2022-4-21"></a>

New Features:

* **Mito is now available in Jupyter Notebooks**. To use Mito in a Jupyter Notebook, follow the [upgrade instructions here.](../how-to/upgrading-mito.md#upgrading-to-mitosheet-on-jupyterlab-3-0). Then, launch `jupyter notebook` to and render a mitosheet as you normally would.

## 2022-4-19 <a href="#2022-4-19" id="2022-4-19"></a>

New Features:

* More Code optimization for Mito Pro users. When the user deletes a dataframe, Mito now deletes all of the code that was used to create that dataframe, in most cases.
* The file browser now works with arrow keys! Woo for efficiency.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixes issues with scrollbars overlapping text, making the text hard to read
* Undo and redo now work with filter and sort
* The rename input field now submits on blur and doesn't add navigation keys like pageup and pagedown to the column name.
* Handles 'yes' and 'no' properly in string to bool conversion

## 2022-4-11 <a href="#2022-4-11" id="2022-4-11"></a>

New Features:

* Code optimization for Mito Pro users. Common scripts now will be 1/3 the size of previous scripts, as Mito automatically generates optimized code as you edit.
* Filter and concatenate operations now display text telling you the result of the operation - how many rows were removed and how many columns were included respectively - making it easier to figure out the effect of these operations.

Bug Fixes:

* Drop duplicates now opens with no column selected, to allow users to opt into changing the data if they are just exploring.

## 2022-4-5 <a href="#2022-4-5" id="2022-4-5"></a>

Bug Fixes:

* Make sheets with massive numbers of columns work with Mito better, by only displaying the first 1500 columns.
* Add a warning to pivot tables letting users know that adding a `column` key with a large number of unique values will cause performance problems.
* Make analysis replaying much more robust by adding an `analysis_to_replay` parameter to the `mitosheet.sheet()` call. This will stop Mito generated code from getting deleted from the sheet, as it did in the past!

## 2022-3-29 <a href="#2022-3-29" id="2022-3-29"></a>

New Features:

* Add concatenate, allowing users to append dataframes vertically. This is our most requested feature!
* Add basic graph styling, allowing users to set graph titles and toggle axes. Mito Pro users can additionally style graph colors.
* Dramatically speed up all Mito operations when the user has multiple large dataframes by copying less data.
* Shrunk the size of the toolbar buttons, to let us give users all the actions they want at their fingertips :-)

Bug Fixes:

* Make Merge and Deduplicate work with Undo and Redo, for better usability.
* Fix a variety of sheet crashing bugs in the graphing taskpane.
* Cleanup and modernize the merge and pivot taskpanes, for ease of development.

## 2022-3-14 <a href="#2022-3-14" id="2022-3-14"></a>

New Features:

* Graphing tabs! Graphs in Mito are now permanent and act like tabs. This allows you to have multiple graphs going at once, and makes it dramatically easier to explore and present your data.
* Format data in the Unique Values and Summary Statistics tab of the column control panel with whatever formatting is applied to the column.

Bug fixes:

* Both undo and redo work with pivot and graphing. No longer will redoing edits lead to parameters getting out of date with the sheet.
* Don't overwrite written code if the user is replaying an analysis that they do not have on their local machine.

## 2022-3-10 <a href="#2022-3-10" id="2022-3-10"></a>

New Features:

* New graph types: Line, Violin, Strip, Density Heatmap, Density Contour, ECDF
* Move graphs to a step performer in order to make them work with Undo, Redo, and Clear.
* New Filter conditions: `Starts With` and `Ends With.`

Bug fixes:

* Fix bug where Mito didn't generate code if there was not a code cell below the Mito spreadsheet.
* Improved error messages when a user attempts to install Mito in VSCode or Google Collab
* Better logging for when race conditions prevent Mito from reading in the name of the passed dataframe arugments correctly.

## 2022-2-28 <a href="#2022-2-28" id="2022-2-28"></a>

New Features:

* Add better filtering to our graphing tab - allow users to opt into seeing the whole dataset.
* Logging improvements to know where we should invest development time going forward.

Bug fixes:

* Make autofocus on Mito inputs work again

## 2022-2-9 <a href="#2022-2-9" id="2022-2-9"></a>

Bug Fixes:

* Add a basic error boundary to stop rare, sheet crashing bugs from breaking your tab.
* Remove API loading column dtypes. Instead access dtypes directly, resulting in less laggy taskpanes.
* Better types across the codebase, fix up of all type errors, for better continued type support.
* Internal refactor of taskpane logic, to cleanup code.
